# AgentFlow POC Demo Guide

## Quick Start POC

This guide shows how to run a working AgentFlow POC with real workflow execution.

### 1. Build All Components

```bash
make build-all
```

This builds:
- `bin/agentflow` - CLI tool
- `bin/orchestrator` - Workflow orchestrator
- `bin/dashboard-server` - Web dashboard
- `bin/mock-agent` - Sample agent for testing

### 2. Start the POC Demo

```bash
make demo
```

This starts:
- ðŸ”§ **Orchestrator** at http://localhost:8080
- ðŸ“Š **Dashboard** at http://localhost:3001

### 3. Deploy a Workflow

Open a new terminal and deploy the hello-world example:

```bash
# Deploy a sample workflow
./bin/agentflow deploy examples/hello-world-pipeline.yaml

# Check status
./bin/agentflow status

# View specific workflow status
./bin/agentflow status hello-world-pipeline
```

### 4. Monitor in Dashboard

Open http://localhost:3001 to see:
- Real-time workflow status
- Agent execution progress
- Success/failure metrics
- Live updates

## What's Working in this POC

### âœ… Core Features
- [x] YAML workflow parsing and validation
- [x] CLI deployment with backend integration
- [x] Workflow orchestrator with DAG execution
- [x] Mock agent execution with dependency resolution
- [x] Real-time status monitoring
- [x] Web dashboard with live updates
- [x] Proper error handling and retries

### ðŸ”„ Example Workflow Execution
1. CLI parses and validates YAML
2. Orchestrator receives workflow via HTTP API
3. DAG executor analyzes dependencies
4. Agents execute in correct order (greeter â†’ processor â†’ publisher)
5. Status updates in real-time
6. Dashboard shows live progress

### ðŸ“Š Dashboard Features
- Workflow statistics (running, completed, failed)
- Live workflow table with status
- Auto-refresh every 30 seconds
- Error display with connection status

## Next Steps for Full Implementation

### ðŸš§ Enhance Agent Execution
- Replace mock agents with actual WASM runtime
- Add real LLM provider integration
- Implement agent-to-agent communication
- Add resource limits and sandboxing

### ðŸ”§ Production Features
- Add persistent storage (PostgreSQL)
- Implement proper authentication
- Add distributed tracing
- Scale with Kubernetes
- Add metrics and alerting

### ðŸ“ˆ Advanced Workflow Features
- Time-travel debugging
- Workflow templates
- Conditional execution
- Event-driven triggers
- Cost tracking

## Testing the POC

```bash
# Quick test
make poc-test

# Manual testing
./bin/agentflow deploy examples/hello-world-pipeline.yaml
./bin/agentflow status hello-world-pipeline
./bin/agentflow status

# View in browser
open http://localhost:3001
```

## POC Value Demonstration

This POC shows:
1. **End-to-end workflow** from YAML â†’ execution â†’ monitoring
2. **Real orchestration** with dependency resolution
3. **Production-ready architecture** with proper APIs
4. **User experience** similar to Kubernetes/Docker Compose
5. **Monitoring & observability** with live dashboard

Perfect for demos, investor presentations, and validating the core concept!
