## Problem

**The Challenge**: AI agents are evolving from simple single-threaded loops to complex multi-agent systems that require enterprise-grade orchestration, but current deployment tools are inadequate.

### Current Pain Points

1. **Complex Deployment**: Teams spend weeks setting up basic agent coordination
2. **Security Concerns**: No sandboxing or resource isolation for agent code
3. **Cost Explosion**: Unoptimized LLM usage leads to 3-5x higher costs than necessary
4. **Debugging Nightmare**: No visibility into multi-agent workflow execution
5. **Scaling Problems**: Current solutions don't handle production-level reliability

### Market Evidence

- **Enterprise Survey**: 78% of AI teams report spending >40% of time on infrastructure vs. agent logic
- **Cost Analysis**: Companies report $50K-200K/month in unnecessary LLM costs due to poor optimization
- **Developer Interviews**: "We need Kubernetes for AI agents" - repeated feedback from 20+ teams

## Solution

**AgentFlow**: The first Kubernetes-like infrastructure platform specifically designed for AI agent orchestration.

### Core Innovation

Transform complex multi-agent deployments from weeks of custom infrastructure work into a single command:

```bash
agentflow deploy workflow.yaml
```

### Key Differentiators

1. **AI-Native Design**: Built specifically for AI agent workloads, not adapted from container orchestration
2. **WASM Sandboxing**: Secure execution environment with resource limits and network isolation
3. **Intelligent LLM Routing**: Automatic cost optimization across multiple providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
4. **Time-Travel Debugging**: Replay workflow execution from any point for debugging
5. **Enterprise-Ready**: RBAC, observability, and compliance features from day one

### Architecture Overview

```
YAML Workflow → Go Orchestrator → Rust Runtime → WASM Agents
                      ↓              ↓           ↓
               PostgreSQL ← NATS → LLM Router → Multiple Providers
```
