# PRODUCT_SPEC.md - Complete Product Specification

## Executive Summary

**Product Name**: AgentFlow Infrastructure

**Mission**: Make deploying and managing multi-agent AI systems as simple and reliable as deploying a web service.

**Vision**: Become the default infrastructure layer for multi-agent AI systems, similar to how Kubernetes became the standard for container orchestration.

**Problem Statement**: 
AI agents are evolving from simple single-threaded loops to complex multi-agent systems. Current deployment tools are inadequate for enterprise-grade agent orchestration. Developers struggle with:

- Complex dependency management between agents
- Resource allocation and sandboxing for secure execution
- Cost optimization across multiple LLM providers
- Debugging and observability in distributed agent systems
- Scaling and reliability for production workloads

**Solution**: 
AgentFlow provides a Kubernetes-like infrastructure for AI agents with YAML-based configuration, automatic orchestration, and enterprise-grade security and observability.

## Product Overview

### Core Value Proposition

1. **Developer Experience**: Deploy complex multi-agent workflows with simple YAML files
2. **Enterprise Security**: WASM-based sandboxing with resource limits and network isolation
3. **Cost Optimization**: Intelligent LLM routing to minimize operational costs
4. **Production Ready**: Built-in observability, retries, and scaling capabilities

### Target Market

**Primary**: AI/ML teams at mid-to-large enterprises building production agent systems
**Secondary**: AI startups scaling from prototype to production
**Tertiary**: Research institutions running complex AI experiments

### Competitive Landscape

| Solution | Focus | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|----------|-------|-----------|------------|
| LangChain | Agent frameworks | Rich ecosystem | No production orchestration |
| CrewAI | Multi-agent systems | Simple API | Limited scalability |
| Kubernetes | Container orchestration | Production-ready | Not AI-native |
| AgentFlow | AI agent infrastructure | **AI-native + Production-ready** | - |

client = AgentFlowClient("https://agentflow.company.com", api_key="...")

# Define workflow programmatically
workflow = Workflow(
    name="data-analysis-pipeline",
    agents=[
        Agent(
            name="data-collector",
            image="agents/collector:v1.0",
            llm=LLMConfig(provider="openai", model="gpt-4"),
            resources={"memory": "512Mi", "cpu": "100m"}
        ),

            name="data-analyzer", 
            image="agents/analyzer:v1.0",
            llm=LLMConfig(provider="anthropic", model="claude-3-sonnet"),
            depends_on=["data-collector"]
        )
    ]
)

# Deploy and monitor
execution = client.deploy_workflow(workflow)
status = client.get_execution_status(execution.id)
logs = client.get_agent_logs(execution.id, "data-collector")

# Stream live updates
for event in client.stream_execution_events(execution.id):
    print(f"Agent {event.agent}: {event.status}")
```

**TypeScript SDK**
```typescript
import { AgentFlowClient, Workflow, Agent } from '@agentflow/sdk';

const client = new AgentFlowClient({
  endpoint: 'https://agentflow.company.com',
  apiKey: process.env.AGENTFLOW_API_KEY
});

const workflow: Workflow = {
  name: 'content-generation-pipeline',
  agents: [
    {
      name: 'content-planner',
      image: 'agents/planner:v1.0',
      llm: { provider: 'openai', model: 'gpt-4' },
      resources: { memory: '256Mi', cpu: '100m' }
    },
    {
      name: 'content-writer',

    }
  ]
};

const execution = await client.deployWorkflow(workflow);
const status = await client.getExecutionStatus(execution.id);
```

#### 4. Enterprise Security & Isolation

**WASM Sandboxing**
- Agent code runs in WebAssembly runtime with strict memory limits
- No direct system access - all I/O through controlled APIs
- Network isolation with allowlisted destinations only
- CPU and memory quotas enforced at runtime

**Resource Management**
```yaml
spec:
  agents:
    - name: heavy-processor
      resources:
        memory: 2Gi           # Memory limit
        cpu: 1000m           # CPU limit (1 core)
        timeout: 600s        # Max execution time
        storage: 1Gi         # Temporary storage
      limits:
        llmCalls: 100        # Max LLM API calls
        networkRequests: 50  # Max external requests
        fileOperations: 1000 # Max file I/O operations
```

**Access Control**
- Role-based access control (RBAC) for workflow management
- API key authentication with scoped permissions
- Audit logging for all operations
- Integration with enterprise identity providers (SSO/SAML)

#### 5. Observability & Debugging

**Distributed Tracing**
- Every workflow execution gets unique trace ID
- Spans for each agent execution with timing data
- LLM call tracing with token usage and costs
- Integration with Jaeger/OpenTelemetry

**Time-Travel Debugging**
```bash
# Replay execution from specific point
agentflow replay execution-123 --from-step data-processor

# View execution at specific timestamp
agentflow debug execution-123 --at-time 2024-01-15T10:30:00Z

# Compare two executions
agentflow diff execution-123 execution-124
```

**Real-Time Monitoring**
- Live workflow visualization with agent status
- Real-time log streaming with filtering
- Cost tracking per execution with provider breakdown
- Performance metrics and alerting

#### 6. Cost Optimization

**Intelligent LLM Routing**
```yaml
spec:
  llmRouting:
    strategy: cost-optimized
    fallbacks:
      - provider: openai
        model: gpt-4
        conditions: 
          - complexity: high
          - accuracy: critical
      - provider: anthropic
