# üöÄ AgentFlow Demo Presentation

## Demo Script for Tonight

### **Opening Hook (30 seconds)**
*"While other tools help you route conversations between agents, AgentFlow orchestrates complex business processes with AI. Think of it as the Kubernetes for AI workflows."*

### **Problem Statement (1 minute)**
*"Enterprises today need to orchestrate complex AI-powered business processes:*
- *Multi-step document processing pipelines*
- *Customer support automation with multiple AI models*
- *Content moderation workflows with compliance requirements*
- *Cost management and budget enforcement*
- *Audit trails and observability*

*Current solutions are either too simple (just agent routing) or too complex (full workflow engines without AI focus)."*

### **AgentFlow Solution (2 minutes)**

#### **The 5-Pillar Architecture**
1. **üéØ AOR (Agent Orchestration Runtime)** - Fan-out/fan-in, retries, backpressure
2. **üìù POP (PromptOps Platform)** - Versioned prompts, evaluation, canary rollouts
3. **üîç SCL (Secure Context Layer)** - PII redaction, compliance, audit trails
4. **üìä AOS (Agent Observability Stack)** - Semantic tracing, replay, root-cause analysis
5. **üí∞ CAS (Cost-Aware Scheduler)** - Budget enforcement, cost optimization

#### **Live Demo Scenarios**

**Scenario 1: Document Analysis Pipeline**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/workflows/submit \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "workflow_name": "document_analysis",
    "workflow_version": 1,
    "inputs": {
      "document_url": "https://example.com/sample.pdf",
      "analysis_type": "comprehensive"
    },
    "budget_cents": 1000
  }'
```

**Scenario 2: Customer Support Automation**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/workflows/submit \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "workflow_name": "customer_support",
    "workflow_version": 1,
    "inputs": {
      "customer_query": "I'm having trouble with my account",
      "priority": "high"
    },
    "budget_cents": 500
  }'
```

**Scenario 3: Content Moderation Workflow**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/workflows/submit \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "workflow_name": "content_moderation",
    "workflow_version": 1,
    "inputs": {
      "content": "Sample user-generated content",
      "platform": "social_media"
    },
    "budget_cents": 300
  }'
```

### **Key Differentiators (1 minute)**

#### **vs Agent Squad (Conversational AI)**
- **Agent Squad**: Routes conversations between agents
- **AgentFlow**: Orchestrates complex business processes with DAGs

#### **vs Temporal/Airflow (Workflow Engines)**

- Show workflow submission and status checking
- Display monitoring and observability

#### **Show the Infrastructure**
- Docker Compose setup
- Multiple databases (PostgreSQL, Redis, ClickHouse)
- NATS messaging
- Monitoring with Prometheus/Grafana

### **Business Value Proposition (1 minute)**

#### **For Enterprises**
- **Compliance**: Built-in PII redaction and audit trails
- **Cost Control**: Budget enforcement and cost optimization
- **Reliability**: Retries, backpressure, idempotency
- **Observability**: Complete traceability and replay capabilities

#### **For Developers**
- **Simple API**: Easy workflow submission and management
- **Flexible**: Support for multiple AI providers
- **Scalable**: Horizontal scaling with worker nodes
- **Observable**: Comprehensive monitoring and debugging

### **Market Opportunity (30 seconds)**
*"The AI workflow orchestration market is growing rapidly. AgentFlow addresses the gap between simple agent routing and complex workflow engines, specifically for AI-native business processes."*

### **Next Steps (30 seconds)**
*"We're looking for early enterprise customers and strategic partners to help us build the future of AI workflow orchestration."*
